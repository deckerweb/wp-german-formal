# Plugin: WP German Formal

Load (custom) formal German translations for WordPress Core - Global, Admin and Network Admin.

## Description

Instead of the packaged language files that come with WordPress - DE Edition - this plugin loads custom language packs translated, maintained and provided via David Decker of DECKERWEB. This includes the following sections: Global/Core, Admin and Network Admin.

* de_DE.mo = the global area, these are the strings that could appear anywhere, frontend, backend, Multisite
* admin-de_DE.mo = strings that only appear in the admin area
* network-admin-de_DE.mo = strings that only appear in the Network admin area in Multisite

Those new language packs are based on the "official language packs" from the DE Edition in the formal version. However, the new language files were heavily modified and a lot of important strings and principals changed.

**Essentials for the Translations (German only!)**

## Updates of the Language Packs plus the Plugin

New versions of these language packs will be provided via new versions of the plugin!

This plugin supports the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you install that first, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub.

## Usage

This plugin has no settings at all because it currently doesn't need them! Just activate it and it will serve you up proper translations! ;-)

Maybe in future versions some admin sub page will be added with useful information and/or a few settings.
